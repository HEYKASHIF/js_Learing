//Create an array that stores the temperatures recorded over 7 days. 
//Use indexing to access the temperature for the 4th day and update it
//to a new value by adding 2 degrees. After that, log the updated temperatures 
//for all 7 days to the console.


// let arrTemp = [10, 11, 9, 8, 13, 10, 5];

// arrTemp[3] = arrTemp[3]+2;

// console.log(arrTemp);

//Problem Statement: Write a function called greetUser that prompts the user to enter their name using the prompt() function.
//If the user enters a name, greet them with the message: "Hello, !". If no name is provided (i.e., the user presses "Cancel" 
// or enters an empty string), the function should use a default name "Guest" and greet them with: "Hello, Guest!".
//equirements:
//Use a function expression. Ensure the function handles cases where the user cancels or leaves the input empty.
